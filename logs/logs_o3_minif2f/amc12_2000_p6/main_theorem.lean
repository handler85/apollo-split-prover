Below is one natural‐language explanation followed by a Lean 4 “skeleton” proof outline. (Each “try norm_cast ; try norm_num ; try simp_all ; try ring_nf at * ; try native_decide ; try linarith ; try nlinarith” marks a place where a detailed proof of a step would go.)
sorry

Natural Language Solution:
1. Factorization Step. Notice that for any numbers p and q we have p·q – (p + q) = (p – 1)(q – 1) – 1.This rewriting will simplify later estimation.2. Identify the Prime Candidates. Since p and q are prime numbers between 4 and 18, the only possibilities are 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.3. Maximum Value Estimation. If we choose two different primes, then to maximize (p – 1)(q – 1) – 1we want the largest factors. The largest prime is 17 (so 17 – 1 = 16) and the next largest is 13 (so 13 – 1 = 12). Hence, the maximum possible value of the expression is 16 · 12 – 1 = 192 – 1 = 191.4. Concluding the Impossibility of 194. Since 194 is strictly greater than this maximum (191), no allowed choice of p and q can make the expression equal to 194.5. (For interest) In fact, one may verify by checking the cases that choosing p = 11 and q = 13 gives (11 – 1)(13 – 1) – 1 = 10 · 12 – 1 = 120 – 1 = 119,which is the correct answer to the original multiple‐choice problem.──────────────────────────────Lean 4 Proof Outline:Below is the Lean 4 code outline that mirrors the steps above.
