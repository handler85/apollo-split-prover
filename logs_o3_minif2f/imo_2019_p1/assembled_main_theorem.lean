Below is a natural language explanation of the solution followed by a Lean 4 proof‐outline whose structure mirrors the steps. In our reasoning we show that any function f : ℤ → ℤ satisfying
  f(2a) + 2 f(b) = f(f(a + b)) for all integers a and b
must be of one of the two types below:
1. f is the zero function, that is, f(x) = 0 for every x ∈ ℤ; or
2. f is “affine” of the form f(x) = 2x + c for some fixed c ∈ ℤ.
Proof Explanation (Natural Language):
Step 1. (Substitutions)
  • Write P(a, b) for “f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a+b)).” 
  • Setting b = 0 gives
    f(2a) + 2 f(0) = f(f(a)).
  • Likewise, setting a = 0 gives
    f(0) + 2 f(b) = f(f(b)).
Step 2. (Relating f(2a) to f(a))
  • For any a, equate the value f(f(a)) computed in the two ways:
    f(2a) + 2 f(0) = f(0) + 2 f(a)
  • Rearranging yields
    f(2a) = 2 f(a) – f(0). (1)
Step 3. (Additivity)
  • Next, substitute (1) back into the equation for general a, b:
    [2 f(a) – f(0)] + 2 f(b) = f(f(a+b))
  • On the other hand, setting b = 0 into the original equation with input a+b gives:
    f(0) + 2 f(a+b) = f(f(a+b)).
  • Equate the two expressions for f(f(a+b)) to get:
    2 f(a) + 2 f(b) – f(0) = f(0) + 2 f(a+b)
  • Rearranging leads to
    f(a) + f(b) = f(a+b) + f(0). 
  • Defining g(x) = f(x) − f(0) (so that g(0) = 0) we see that g is additive:
    g(a+b) = g(a) + g(b). 
  • Since every additive map from ℤ to ℤ is linear (of the form k·x for some integer k), we can write
    f(x) = k · x + f(0) for all x ∈ ℤ.
Step 4. (Determining k)
  • Substitute this form into (1):
    f(2a) = k · (2a) + f(0) and 2 f(a) − f(0) = 2 (k a + f(0)) − f(0) = 2 k a + f(0).
  • So (1) is automatically satisfied.
  • Now plug f(x) = kx + f(0) into the original equation:
    LHS = (2 k a + f(0)) + 2 (k b + f(0)) = 2 k (a+b) + 3 f(0)
    RHS = f(f(a+b)) = f(k (a+b) + f(0)) = k² (a+b) + k · f(0) + f(0).
  • The equality for all a, b forces:
    2 k = k² and 3 f(0) = (k+1) f(0).
  • The first equation gives k = 0 or 2. The second equation shows that when k = 0 we must have f(0) = 0. • Hence, either k = 0 (so f ≡ 0) or k = 2 (with f(0) arbitrary). In the second case f(x) = 2x + c where c = f(0).Step 5. (Converse) • One then easily checks that if f(x) ≡ 0 or if f(x) = 2x+c then f satisfies the functional equation.Thus the original equation is equivalent to: for every z, either f(z) = 0 or there exists a constant c (independent of z) such that f(z) = 2z+c.Below is the Lean 4 proof outline corresponding to the above reasoning.
